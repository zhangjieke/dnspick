// The heuristic is GetConsoleProcessList: a console owned only by us reports a
// single attached process, whereas a console inherited from cmd.exe/PowerShell
// reports at least two (the shell and us). In the latter case the window
// survives on its own and pausing would just be annoying, so we do nothing.
